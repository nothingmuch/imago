directory layout:
	lib contains code, installable, sharable
	resc contains non code resources, installable, sharable

	it should be possible to install the app layout somewhere sharable, and create
	new app instances (keys/config, data)

	should resources be in @INC? e.g. override data/objects.yml in PWD?


complex actions:

	POST actions:

		instead of rendering to a uri these render using HTML::Zoom by altering
		a form (add_attribute( action => ... ), append <hidden>)

	client side closures:

		serialize closure using KiokuX::MessageBus into a tamper proof cookie

		the URI has a UUID e.g. /cont/...uuid..., and the cookie is constrained to that path

		$action->to_link returns a Widget::Link with the cookie as an annotation
